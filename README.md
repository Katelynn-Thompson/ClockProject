# ClockProject
A clock that displays a twelve and twenty-four hour clock with options to change the hour, minute, and seconds.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This projects goal was to display two clocks one being a twelve hour and the other a twenty four hour clock while also adding options to add to the hour, minute, and seconds of both.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did well using ctime, at first I struggled to get the code to work however after finishing it, it made me feel much more accomplished in my skills.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
A way I could enhance my code is to seperate the adding of hours, minutes, and seconds to a specific clock and possibly adding an option to change time zones. Doing this would add more options and make the program more customizable to the user.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of writing the code for me was getting the twenty-four-hour clock to read the time correctly. After a bunch of trial and error, I finally set a cap when making the add options for the hours, minutes, and seconds. I also had issues setting variables however utilized the pragma warning to bypass this, and thankfully the code worked!

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think knowing how to utilize the ctime feature will help me in the future when making programs and websites.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made my program readable and adaptable by separating part of the code, for example: setting the int variables for the hour, minutes, and seconds, the clocks, and the addition of adding the hour, minutes, and seconds outside of main which overall made the flow of code much more manageable and readable.
